# RforBiochemists201_sandpit
A repository for R for Biochemists 201 learners to play and learn

We can make changes to this file. 
And when we make changes, we should COMMIT them...

The next thing to learn is that we can FORK other peoples repositories. 
Then we can make changes. 
Again, we need to COMMIT these changes. 

# We need to be careful to keep up to date with the Upstream repository....
